description: AI input field patterns for chat and prompt UIs.
---

The SilkUI AI input blocks provide ready-to-use patterns for chat-style and prompt-style inputs. These components live under `components/silkui/ai-input`.

## Variants

- `ai-input-01` / `ai-input-02`: Compact message bars with send actions.
- `ai-input-03`: Input with quick suggestion chips.
- `ai-input-04`: Multiline prompt with attachment + run controls.
- `ai-input-05` / `ai-input-06`: Inline inputs with secondary actions (history, settings).

## Usage

Import the variant you need and render it directly. Each variant is self-contained.

```tsx
import { AIInput04 } from "@/components/silkui/ai-input/ai-input-04";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-2xl">
      <AIInput04 />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> Tip: Wrap in a container (`max-w-*`) to control layout. The inputs are unstyled beyond Tailwind utility classes included in the component.

## Props

These variants are primarily presentational and do not require props. If you need behavior (e.g., submit handlers), wrap the component and attach your own state/handlers around the input elements inside.
