title: Alert
description: Alert components for feedback and status messaging.

SilkUI includes multiple alert styles under `components/silkui/alert`. Use them to display inline feedback, status, or contextual info.

## Variants

- `alert-01`: Basic success/info alert with icon and text.
- `alert-02`: Alert with accent bar for emphasis.
- `alert-03`: Dismissible alert with close affordance.
- `alert-04`: Alert with actions (links/buttons).

## Usage

```tsx
import { Alert03 } from "@/components/silkui/alert/alert-03";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <Alert03 />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> Note: The variants are self-contained. If you need to wire close/CTA behavior, wrap the component and hook into the rendered buttons/links.

## Design Notes

- Icons come from `lucide-react`; colors rely on Tailwind utilities baked into each variant.
- Keep alerts concise; for longer content, pair with a dismiss action.
